===================================

You found my blog! After countless try-and-fail attempts, I finally decided to use Sphinx to build my blog (for now).
I'm HT, a deep learning & AI engineer/researcher/programmer/scientist or whatever you call it.
My research currently focuses on LLM based Vision-Language information extraction/retrival tasks such as
Super Human-level Handwriting Recognition, Document QA,
textual/image/video summery and retrivals, etc. Check here 
for more details about my technical background and projects.

I'm also passionate about `Photography <https://gallery.htplex.io>`_ and :doc:`Cooking </food/index>` .

:doc:`Here </tinyWiki/index>` , you will mostly find the notes I accumulated during my work and study,
 spanning a wide range of topics, in the form of short and concise blog posts,
I hope they can be helpful to you.


.. note::

   This blog is under active development. Be ware of lots of nonsense placeholders.
